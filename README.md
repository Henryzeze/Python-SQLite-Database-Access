### Overview

This project demonstrates how to create and access an SQLite database using Python. SQLite is a powerful software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, and transactional SQL database engine. It's widely recognized and deployed as one of the most used SQL database engines globally.

### Project Description

The main objective of this project is to illustrate the process of working with SQLite databases using Python. SQLite provides a simple yet robust solution for handling SQL databases without the need for a separate server process. This project showcases the creation of an SQLite database and accessing it through Python, allowing for seamless database operations.

### Features

- **Database Creation**: Demonstrates the creation of an SQLite database file.
- **Python SQLite Integration**: Illustrates how to perform SQL operations using Python's SQLite library.
- **Basic Database Operations**: Shows examples of performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the SQLite database.
